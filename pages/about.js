        Hello! Iâ€™m Sam, a Front-End Developer based in Modesto, California who
        enjoys designing things on the web. I am passionate about web
        development and creating products that users can easily use without
        having to think.
        <br />
        <br />
        This past fall, I received by B.S. in Computer Science from California
        State University, Stanislaus. During my time as a student I was
        fortunate enough to be able to join Novo Technologies as a Software
        Developer Intern where I practiced agile development and worked with
        JavaScript, React and a variety of modern web technologies on a daily
        basis.
